# Project-Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a system that can identify the emotion of different audio  samples. And give the accurate result for the given audio. SER is the act of attempting to Recognize human emotion and affective states from speech
<h2>Emotions available</h2>
There are 9 emotions available: "neutral", "calm", "happy" "sad", "angry", "fear", "disgust", "ps" (pleasant surprise) and "boredom".
<h2>Feature Extraction</h2>
Feature extraction is the main part of the speech emotion recognition system. It is basically accomplished by changing the speech waveform to a form of parametric representation at a relatively lesser data rate.

In this repository, we have used the most used features that are available in librosa library including:
<ul>
<li>MFCC</li>
<li>Chromagram</li>
<li>MEL Spectrogram Frequency (mel)</li>
</ul>
